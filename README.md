# Driven-by-Hyperfocus-ADHD-

The AD/HD Society of the Philippines, established in 2000, is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting individuals with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Initially formed as a parent-based group, the Society has since evolved into a diverse and balanced collective of medical practitioners, academicians, Special Education (SPED) professionals, parents, and adults with ADHD.

Our mission is to empower these individuals and their families, fostering a robust network of stakeholders to advocate for their needs. We strive to be an accessible, compassionate, and responsive organization, promoting the well-being of persons with ADHD through various programs, projects, and activities.

Our notable achievements include raising ADHD awareness in the Philippines and emphasizing the significance of early identification and treatment. Our steadfast commitment to the welfare of individuals with ADHD propels our continuous efforts to ensure that everyone with this condition can access the necessary support and resources.
